<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Rakshitha. I am a 19 year old college student studying Computer Science. I want to study web deveopment 
  because creating projects and art really excites. To be able to build something beautiful and functional is such an 
  exciting and fun thing.
</p>

<p>I make art in my free time. I like staying active at all times. Staying idle is not something I can ever ever do.</p>

<p>I currently live in Chennai, India. I stay in a hostel, so going to classes doesnt take up too much time of my day.</p>
